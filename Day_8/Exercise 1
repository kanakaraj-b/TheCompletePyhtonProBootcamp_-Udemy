Introduction: Using function with inputs to find the number of cans of paint needed to paint a wall with defined hight and weight.

import math

def paint_calc(height,width,cover):
	no_of_Cans=(height*width)/cover
	no_of_Cans=math.ceil(no_of_Cans)
	print(f"You'll need {no_of_Cans} cans of paint.")
  
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
